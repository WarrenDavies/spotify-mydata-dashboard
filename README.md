# spotify-mydata-dashboard

App to visualise the data you can request from Spotify about your listening history.

Currently building the structure of the React app, adding components, and getting data in the right shape/places.

Still need to do the front end work (not pretty at the moment, just using placeholder colours to distinguish elements) and add in D3 to set up the visualisations.
